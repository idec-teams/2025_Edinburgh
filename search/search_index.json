HIS1 (HPPD Inhibitor Sensitive 1), a Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase, demonstrated up to 13.55% degradation of PP in optimal conditions, highlighting a potential single-enzyme solution<sup>1</sup>. We aimed to improve the efficiency of HIS1 through a semi-rational directed evolution approach<sup>2</sup>, generating a more hydrophobic interface for improved substrate affinity. We tested an array of assays for the detection of PP degradation in the presence of the unmodified HIS1. TBO and Ni-PV assays show robust and reproducible signals; their compatibility with high-throughput workflows was demonstrated through a proof-of-concept positive control test. AFM scans indicated increases in PP surface roughness after purified HIS1 treatment, but additional results provided limited corroborating evidence. Computational analyses indicated seven residues for mutation; library construction was initiated but deferred. By addressing the lack of a high-throughput screen, our research aims to accelerate progress in polymer degradation</p> <ol> <li> <p>TAN, Q. L., CHEN, W. T., LIU, H., YAN, W.
