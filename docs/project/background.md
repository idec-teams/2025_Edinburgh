### Polypropylene and its challenges
Polypropylene (PP) accounts for 14% of global polymer production, yet its recycling rate remains below 1% [1]. Approximately 60% of manufactured plastics are ultimately discarded, contributing to landfill accumulation and environmental pollution [2]. While most research on plastic biodegradation has targeted hydrolysable polymers like PET, PP remains resistant due to its non-hydrolysable backbone and high crystallinity [3]. The chemical structure of PP, consisting of strong covalent bonds [CH3CH6]n, makes it highly resistant to enzymatic attack. 

Degradation of PP typically occurs through abiotic pathways, primarily initiated by UV-induced cleavage of C-H bonds. This photochemical process generates hydroperoxides and triggers radical chain reactions, leading to β-scission and the formation of oxygenated fragments like ketones, aldehydes, and olefins. This process can be seen in the figure below.

### The discovery of HIS1

A recent breakthrough identified an enzyme capable of notable PP degradation through hydroxylation. Tan et al. performed a metagenomic screen for bioremediation-related enzyme sequences, leading to the discovery of HIS1, an Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase originally found in *Oryza sativa japonica*. 
This enzyme family employs a conserved 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad to activate O₂, generating a high-valent Fe(IV)=O intermediate, and abstract hydrogen atoms from otherwise inert C–H bonds before hydroxylation [4].

HIS1 is known to confer resistance to multiple β-triketone herbicides (bTHs), such as benzobicylon (BBC), by catalysing their hydroxylation, which neutralises their HPPD-targeting activity [5]. Its demonstrated ability to detoxify a wide range of structurally related substrates highlights its promiscuity and suggests a potential function as a polypropylene oxygenase (PPase) capable of polymer hydroxylation.

### Directed Evolution Approaches for PP degradation

Directed evolution (DE) is a powerful strategy for improving biomolecule function. It mimics natural evolution by generating genetic diversity through mutagenesis, followed by screening for desired traits. In this project, we applied a combination of site-directed and combinatorial mutagenesis to target surface-exposed residues of HIS1. The hypothesis was that increasing hydrophobicity at these residues would enhance binding to PP surfaces through stronger hydrophobic interactions.

### High-Throughput Screening Assay Development

A major challenge in applying DE to PP degradation is the lack of high-throughput assays capable of detecting subtle enzymatic activity on polymers. To address this, an important goal of this project was to develop a novel screening method that detects functional groups produced by polymer oxidation. This approach would enable the efficient evaluation of the mutant library and provide a valuable tool for other DE projects targeting polymers similar to PP.
