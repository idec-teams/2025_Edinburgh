# Development of a High-Throughput Assay for Directed Evolution of Polypropylene-Degrading Enzyme HIS1

## Abstract

The UK produced 197.1 thousand metric tonnes of polypropylene (PP) in 2022; only ~1% of this
gets recycled. HIS1 (HPPD Inhibitor Sensitive 1), a Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase,
demonstrated up to 13.55% degradation of PP in optimal conditions, highlighting a potential
single-enzyme solution (Tan et al., 2024). We aimed to improve the efficiency of HIS1 through a
semi-rational directed evolution approach (Delgado et al., 2019), generating a more
hydrophobic interface for improved substrate affinity. We tested an array of assays for the
detection of PP degradation in the presence of the unmodified HIS1. TBO and Ni-PV assays
show robust and reproducible signals; their compatibility with high-throughput workflows was
demonstrated through a proof-of-concept positive control test. AFM scans indicated increases in
PP surface roughness after purified HIS1 treatment, but additional results provided limited
corroborating evidence. Computational analyses indicated seven residues for mutation; library
construction was initiated but deferred. By addressing the lack of a high-throughput screen, our
research aims to accelerate progress in polymer degradation
