# Lab notebooks

### Week 1 (17/06 – 21/06)

- Conducted preliminary research on HIS1 structure, mechanism, and potential polypropylene (PP) binding.
- Began molecular docking of HIS1 and PP.
- Prepared reagents for enzyme purification.
- 23/06: acquired HIS1-PPase construct.
- 24/06–26/06: Expressed HIS1 in E. coli BL21(DE3) and lysed via sonication.
- 27/06: Supervisor meeting — project plan updated.

### Week 2 (30/06 – 04/07)

- Continued purification preparation.
- 01/07: First purification attempt — no elution peak (imidazole too low).
- 02/07: Repeated purification (500 mM imidazole), began thrombin cleavage.
- 03/07-04/07: Ran SDS-PAGE to compare lysis methods.
- Set up degradation mixtures (HIS1, EV, pure protein) with plastic films/fibres.

### Week 3 (07/07 – 11/07)

- Daily degradation exchanges (GC-MS prep).
- Optimised Surface Contact Angle (SCA) analysis using ImageJ.
- Set up AFM degradation samples (red PP squares).
- Explored HIS1 activity assays via mass spec and Ni²⁺–PV assay (initial calibration issues).

### Week 4 (14/07 – 18/07)

- Sent AFM samples (48h degradation) to Dr Laura Charlton.
- Confirmed HIS1 stability (no precipitation).
- Continued SCA optimisation, prepared for tensiometer use.
- Refined Ni-PV assay (identified lysate/Fe²⁺ interference).

### Week 5 (21/07 – 25/07)

- Performed Ni-PV assay, TLC, and heat-treated PP degradation.
- Trained on tensiometer, ran dansyl chloride assay (first tests).
- Conducted IMAC purification of HIS1 for Succinate-Glo testing.
- Molecular cloning work: Began cloning of vector backbone for downstream mutagenesis. Miraprep protocol failed (streaky bands); switched to miniprep kit. Primers arrived → initiated single-site directed mutagenesis (BsaI-incorporated primers).

### Week 6 (28/07 – 01/08)

- Ran Succinate-Glo assays (black/white plates, calibration faulty).
- Tested lactic acid and ethanol as positive controls (unsuccessful).
- Planned acidified KMnO₄ oxidation for PP surface activation.
- Began SCA measurements on untreated plastics.
- 01/08: Positive AFM results confirmed continuation of HIS1 work.
- Molecular cloning: Miniprep successful; gel purification failed. Ran restriction digests (EcoRI/HindIII) — 90–120 min optimal. Continued mutagenesis optimisation (DMSO, GC Enhancer). Ordered megaprimer primers for the next protocol.

### Week 7  (04/08 – 08/08)

- Lab closed (04/08–06/08) → troubleshooting assays and developing new cleaning/drying protocols.
- 07/08: Purified HIS1 and EV (for Succinate-Glo control).
- 08/08: Supervisor meeting.
- SCA restarted using new protocol (sonication, oven dry, triplicates).
- Molecular cloning: Single-site mutagenesis failed → switched to megaprimer approach. Began optimising asymmetric PCR for residue 110 (cycle and temperature testing).

### Week of (11/08 – 15/08)

- Set up Succinate-Glo reactions, EV expression (Days 1–3).
- Sent 2nd AFM batch (biological triplicates) to Dr Charlton.
- Conducted 24h–72h surface contact measurements using refined protocol.
- FTIR meeting with Dr Dimartino.
- Optimised TLC for HPP → HGA (ethyl acetate : hexane : acetic acid = 70 : 30 : 2).
- Molecular cloning:

Continued asymmetric PCR optimisation (extension = 60 s; primer ratio = 100 : 1) → clear asymmetric band achieved.

Week of 18 – 22 August

Set up degradations for TBO and Ni-PV assays; performed acidified KMnO₄ treatment (positive control established).

GC-MS results received.

AFM meeting — residue interference identified; samples to be re-cleaned.

Recharged IMAC column, ran full-length PCR and DNA extraction.

Molecular cloning:

Asymmetric PCR product yield low → pooled multiple 50 µL reactions.

Initiated full-length gene synthesis (residue 110).

Began optimising asymmetric PCR for additional target residues.

Week of 25 – 29 August

Prepared fresh HIS1/EV lysates for purification; completed HIS1 purification (two batches, SpinDown).

Set up FTIR and TBO degradations with purified HIS1.

Prepared 18 FTIR samples (KMnO₄, HEPES, untreated, EV, HIS1 lysate, pure HIS1).

Exchanged degradation solutions at 24 h and 48 h; performed TBO assay.

29 Aug: Stopped reactions; ultrasonically cleaned FTIR plastics (SDS → water → ethanol → 50 °C dry).

Molecular cloning:

Full-length gene synthesis successful (faint bands).

Performed DpnI/EcoRI/HindIII digestion, gel purification, ligation into backbone, transformation.

Low backbone concentration initially failed → increased DNA input produced colonies.

Week of 1 – 5 September

Generated asymmetric PCR products for residues 110, 148, 268, 297, 304, 305.

Attempted full-length gene synthesis — no bands observed.

Deferred combinatorial library synthesis (time constraints).

Sequenced heterogenous liquid culture → inconclusive; resubmitted individual colonies.

Week of 8 – 12 September

Sequencing confirmed no mutations in individual colonies.

Directed evolution and mutagenesis work halted due to time and screening limitations.
