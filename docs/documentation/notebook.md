# Lab notebooks

**Pre-lab Research**

* Research into HIS1 (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitor sensitive enzyme)

**Week 1 (16/06-22/06)**  
* Preliminary Research into HIS1 (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitor sensitive enzyme)  
* Worked on understanding the mechanism of the enzyme  
* Analysed the structure  
* Started modelling and docking PP on HIS1  


**Week 2 (23/06-29/06)**  
* Supervisor meeting  
* Acquired HIS1 and empty vector (EV) constructs  
* Expressed the HIS1 and EV constructs  

**Week 3 (30/06-06/07)**  
* first round of purification  
  * Elution did not show an absorbance peak  
* More expression of HIS1 and EV constructs and stored cell pellets at -20áµ’C for future use.  
* Purified the constructs and ran an SDS gel to confirm expression of HIS1
